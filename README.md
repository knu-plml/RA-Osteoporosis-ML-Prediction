This repository contains the Python code for predicting osteoporosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis using machine learning. 

## Overview

In this project, we developed various machine learning models to predict the risk of osteoporosis in patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoporosis is a common comorbidity in rheumatoid arthritis patients, and early detection is crucial for effective management.

## Usage models
- `Logistic Regeression`, `LR`
- `Random Forest`, `RF`
- `XGBoost`, `XGB`
- `LightGBM`, `LGB`


## Usage
- `main.py`: contains the overall code for training and experimenting with the models.
- `utils.py`: contains code for output and visualization.
- `params.py`: stores values for tuning the hyperparameters of `LR`, `RF`, `XGB`, and `LGB`. You can change these values to tune hyperparameters.

## Data
- Raw data were generated by the Clinical Research Center for RA in Korea. The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors upon request.
